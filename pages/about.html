      About me!
    </h1>
    <p>
      By now you have probably read the main page, my name is Tony Brown. I love photography, nature, skiing and my
      family, but there is so much more to know!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Utah native and loved playing sports growing up. My favorites (besides skiing) were football and
      basketball. I lived in Germany for two years as a missionary for my church before attending BYU as a student
      studying Zoology. While studying I met my wife and now we have 5 children.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became interested in photography as a means to document family memories. I have 5 children and one awesome wife.
      I realized as a young father that my oldest and favorite son would not always be the same, and while I welcomed
      that change (at least until he became a moody teenager) I wanted to remember his childhood, and provide him with
      the same opportunity. I bought a camera and camcorder and began to document his life: birthdays, Christmases,
      hikes (I love nature remember).
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a second son provided a challenge, because now I had to corral two energetic toddlers into my camera's
      phrame, bribe and intice the smiles out of their faces, and quickly take the photo before anything went wrong.
      Luckily my awesome wife was always there to help. Thanks to boy #2 and the three children that followed, I have
      mastered the ability to photograph children.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would love to help you document your family's precious time. I know photography isn't for all dads, but a lot of
      us want to document our childrens' growth. Feel free to contact me if you're interested!
    </p>
